We would like to bring to your attention a critical issue regarding unauthorized modifications in the GESTAB tables during the MIAMI project:
	•	A502 is a GESTAB that includes the account type.
	•	A513 is a GESTAB where the account type is linked to a subcode. If no subcode is present, the default mapping is set to 000.

As part of the MIAMI project, the project team introduced two new subcodes (001 and 002) linked to account type 002 (Loro account). This change altered the default mapping without prior approval.

Despite multiple requests from the Paris team for the project group to consult the GESTAB owner before making modifications, these requests were ignored. The team proceeded with testing and even requested deployment without validation from the AT2 MOA team. Eventually, the Paris team escalated the matter to AT2 MOA, recognizing that modifying a standard account type required formal validation.

Had this change been deployed, it would have had a significant impact across the group due to incorrect mapping. To mitigate this risk, we have requested an immediate rollback of these unauthorized changes, as such modifications should not have been made without proper governance and approval.

We want to ensure management is aware of this situation. We are happy to provide further details or discuss preventive measures to avoid similar occurrences in the future.



Future Expectations:

To prevent similar unauthorized changes in the future, we propose the following governance measures:
	1.	Mandatory Approval Before Changes
	•	Any modification to GESTAB must be formally validated by the GESTAB owner and impacted stakeholders before implementation.
	•	A documented approval process must be followed, ensuring accountability at each step.
	2.	Stakeholder Involvement in Critical Changes
	•	Changes affecting standard account types must be reviewed with all relevant teams, including AT2 MOA and the Paris team, before execution.
	•	Project teams must engage in discussions proactively rather than seeking approvals after changes are made.
	3.	Deployment Requests Only After Validation
	•	No deployment requests should be raised until all required approvals are obtained and documented.
	•	Any request without prior validation should be rejected by the deployment team.
	4.	Impact Assessment as a Standard Process
	•	Before implementing any changes, a thorough impact assessment must be conducted to evaluate potential risks and system-wide effects.
	•	If a modification affects default mappings or standard configurations, it should be treated as a high-risk change and require additional scrutiny.

We seek management’s support in reinforcing these expectations to ensure governance, accountability, and risk mitigation. Please let us know if a further discussion is required.




During the meeting, we were informed that the Miami SG team is planning to replicate Miami EMEA data. In this context, there is no involvement for Fresh.

However, it appears that, in addition to data replication, modifications were made to Gestab, which includes standard parameters, without prior validation. The Paris HO team had advised consulting the MOA team multiple times, but no formal concerns were raised by the MOA team.

Since Miami EMEA operates on a different platform, it should not be synchronized with CIB. On the other hand, SG Miami is a project within CIB and should remain aligned with it. Moving forward, our expectation is that any changes to standard components such as Gestab, GA Loader, etc., should go through the necessary approval process to ensure alignment and consistency.
