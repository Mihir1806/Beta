I have a Python script that reads and processes multiple Excel files using a for loop. Inside the loop, the script performs several operations including:
	•	Conditional logic using if-else
	•	Parent-child hierarchy resolution
	•	Lookups and mapping (similar to VLOOKUP or dictionary-based matching)
	•	Data merging, filtering, and transformation

The current implementation works correctly but is slow when handling many or large Excel files.

Please optimize the script for speed and memory efficiency without changing its logic or output.

Requirements:
	•	Preserve all existing functionality and logic exactly as is.
	•	Optimize performance by:
	•	Avoiding repeated pd.concat inside loops
	•	Using efficient pandas/vectorized operations where possible
	•	Applying parallel processing (ThreadPoolExecutor, joblib, etc.) to read files
	•	Keep using Excel files (do not convert to CSV or other formats)
	•	Add clear comments explaining performance improvements
	•	Output clean and optimized Python code that produces the same final result
