Objective:
Create a user-friendly web app using Python (Flask) and HTML that allows users to upload multiple Alteryx workflows (.yxmd/.yxmc), extracts formulas from Formula, Multi-Row Formula, and Filter tools, and converts them to Spark SQL.

üîß Functionality Requirements:
	1.	File Upload:
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to upload multiple Alteryx workflows (.yxmd/.yxmc) using a file browser.
	‚Ä¢	Only .yxmd and .yxmc formats should be allowed.
	2.	Formula Extraction:
	‚Ä¢	Parse uploaded XML files and extract expressions from:
	‚Ä¢	Formula tools
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Row Formula tools
	‚Ä¢	Filter tools
	3.	Conversion Logic:
	‚Ä¢	Convert Alteryx expressions to Spark SQL by handling:
	‚Ä¢	IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF ‚Üí CASE WHEN THEN ELSE END
	‚Ä¢	Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
	‚Ä¢	String functions: LEFT(), RIGHT(), UPPER(), LOWER(), Contains()
	‚Ä¢	Date/Time: DateTimeNow() ‚Üí CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
	‚Ä¢	Add more pattern mappings as needed
	4.	Interactive Table:
	‚Ä¢	Display results in a table with columns:
	1.	Alteryx Workflow
	2.	Tool Type
	3.	Alteryx Formula
	4.	Converted Spark SQL
	‚Ä¢	Add inline editing for both formulas (original & converted).
	‚Ä¢	Support saving changes in the table.
	5.	Download Option:
	‚Ä¢	Include a ‚ÄúDownload as Excel‚Äù button to export the table data.

üé® UI/UX Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Clean, responsive layout using HTML + CSS (Bootstrap or custom)
	‚Ä¢	Intuitive flow:
	‚Ä¢	Upload ‚Üí Convert ‚Üí View ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Export
	‚Ä¢	Optional enhancements:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Highlight differences in formula (diff view)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Filter/search by workflow or tool
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Dark/light mode toggle
