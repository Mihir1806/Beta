We require a high-end laptop with GPU acceleration to efficiently process large datasets using Python libraries like Pandas, RAPIDS, and CuDF. Current workflows involve heavy data transformations, which are slow on CPU-only systems. GPU support drastically reduces execution time and improves overall productivity. This upgrade is critical for scaling data operations and meeting tight project deadlines.
