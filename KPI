I am experiencing significant performance issues on my HVD. The RAM usage remains consistently high—around 11.5 GB out of 12 GB—which causes the system to run extremely slowly and impacts overall productivity.

The IT team has already attempted to delete cache files, but there has been no improvement in memory usage.

Additionally, I’m facing issues while working with Alteryx. Even after saving a workflow, the changes often do not get saved correctly. When I reopen the file, it either shows an older autosaved version or appears to be deleted, making it difficult to work reliably.

Requesting your support in resolving these issues at the earliest.
