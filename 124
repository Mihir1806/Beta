Redesign the Job Analytics Dashboard interface to have a modern, minimalist look while preserving all existing features and data. Keep all components in place, but visually enhance them as follows:
	•	Use a light theme with a white or soft gray background instead of the current dark theme.
	•	Replace blocky elements with rounded corners throughout (cards, buttons, input fields, etc.).
	•	Style the buttons (“Today”, “7 Days”, “30 Days”, “Apply Date Range”, “Reset Filters”) with soft shadows, subtle hover effects, and muted blue gradients.
	•	Use modern sans-serif fonts with medium weight for readability and a cleaner appearance.
	•	Introduce a card layout for sections like Filter Options, Job Status Distribution, and the Job Table – each with a soft drop shadow.
	•	Update the pie chart to a sleeker, flat design with a pastel green for “Success” and coral red for “Failure”, and animate the segments on hover.
	•	Style the job table with:
	•	White background and subtle row separators.
	•	Light blue highlight for hovered rows.
	•	Rounded table headers and better spacing for columns.
	•	Align text for readability and add minimal border radius around the table box.
	•	Remove all heavy outlines; use fine lines or light separators for divisions.
	•	Keep all existing labels, filters, and data fields unchanged in position and naming.
