To modernize your Job Analytics Dashboard with a look and feel similar to the FinSet dashboard, use a clean, light-themed design. Start with a soft light grey or off-white background (#F9FAFB) to give a calm and minimal appearance. Each card or widget — such as the job list, job status distribution, and filter options — should have a pure white background (#FFFFFF) with smooth rounded corners (around 16px) and a subtle soft shadow (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)) to add depth and layering.

The primary accent color throughout the dashboard should be a modern, vibrant purple (#7C3AED). Use this for primary buttons (like “Apply Date Range”), active tabs, highlighted elements, and portions of graphs. For hover states or subtle highlights, use a lighter lavender tone (#C4B5FD).

To indicate job success or failure, use a fresh green (#10B981) for success statuses and elements, and a bright red (#EF4444) for failure indicators. This color coding can also be applied in pie charts, status badges, or text labels.

Typography should remain clean and professional, with primary text in a deep grey (#111827) and secondary or less important text in a soft grey (#6B7280). Use light grey dividers or table borders (#E5E7EB) to separate content without cluttering the UI. Altogether, this styling will make your dashboard feel modern, user-friendly, and visually engaging.








1. Use Card-Based Layouts
	•	Wrap each section (Filters, Chart, Table) in a rounded card with subtle shadow and padding.
	•	Maintain consistent spacing between cards.

⸻

2. Apply Modern Styling
	•	Use a dark theme with a consistent color palette (dark background, soft blue accents, white text).
	•	Apply rounded corners to all UI elements (buttons, input fields, table).

⸻

3. Enhance Table Appearance
	•	Use striped rows for better readability.
	•	Add status badges with colors (green for success, red for failure).
	•	Bold headers with a slightly different background color.
	•	Add hover effects on rows.

⸻

4. Improve Interactions
	•	Make buttons clickable with hover and pressed states.
	•	Enable sorting on table columns (visually indicated with arrows).
	•	Include a search/filter bar above the table for quick access.

⸻

5. Typography & Spacing
	•	Use a clean font like Inter or Roboto.
	•	Keep consistent padding and margins (e.g., 16px or 24px).
	•	Ensure text is left-aligned, readable, and properly sized.

⸻

6. Data Visualization
	•	Use a donut chart with smooth edges and labels inside.
	•	Use light gradients or soft shadows to add depth to visual elements

Please redesign the entire interface to follow modern UI/UX principles. The dashboard includes:
	•	A pie chart for job status distribution (success/failure) using matplotlib.
	•	A job table (with job name, status, execution time).
	•	Date filter buttons (Today, 7 Days, 30 Days).
	•	A custom calendar widget for date range selection.

Redesign Goals:

1. Overall Visual Style:
	•	Use a clean light theme with lots of white space and gentle accent colors.
	•	All UI elements should have rounded corners.
	•	Add subtle shadows or simulate elevation for frames and widgets using layered Canvas, gradients, or ttk themes.
	•	Use consistent margins/padding, and modern fonts (e.g., Segoe UI, Roboto).

2. Date Filter Buttons:
	•	Replace standard Button with pill-shaped, rounded buttons.
	•	Add hover and click animations (change background, soft shadow).
	•	Button layout should be horizontal and responsive.

3. Job Status Chart (Matplotlib):
	•	Keep using matplotlib, but:
	•	Style as a donut chart with bold colors: green (success), red (failure).
	•	Hide axes/grid for a minimal look.
	•	Show total jobs inside the donut chart.

4. Job Table:
	•	Use a styled ttk.Treeview with:
	•	Alternating row colors (zebra striping).
	•	Hover effects or row highlight on select.
	•	Icons or emojis for success/failure (green check/red cross).
	•	Rounded frame and scrollbars with modern styling.

5. Custom Calendar Widget:
	•	Redesign calendar popup to look modern:
	•	Rounded frame with soft drop shadow.
	•	Highlight today’s date and selected range using accent color (e.g., blue).
	•	Use modern fonts and spacing between days.
	•	Add navigation arrows (left/right) for changing months.
	•	Use color highlights and subtle animations for hover/select states.

6. Extra Enhancements (Optional):
	•	Add a top navigation bar with app title and profile icon.
	•	Make layout resizable/responsive.
	•	Support dark/light mode toggle if possible.

Tech Stack:
	•	Python
	•	tkinter + ttk (UI components)
	•	matplotlib (for chart)
	•	tkcalendar or custom calendar (for date selection)
	•	Optional: PIL for icons/images
