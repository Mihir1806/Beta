1. Clean, Modern UI Design
	•	Minimalist layout: Use whitespace strategically to avoid clutter.
	•	Rounded corners and soft shadows for cards and buttons.
	•	Flat or neumorphic design depending on the vibe (neumorphism feels more playful, flat feels sleek and modern).

2. Visual Hierarchy
	•	Bold headers with large, modern fonts.
	•	Contrasting color highlights for key stats or alerts.
	•	Subtle dividers and typography to separate sections without overwhelming the eye.

3. Interactive & Animated Elements
	•	Hover effects on widgets and graphs.
	•	Micro-interactions (e.g., smooth transitions when switching tabs or filtering data).
	•	Use Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth UI animations.

4. Data Visualization
	•	Use vibrant, but accessible color palettes.
	•	Interactive charts (hover to reveal values, zoom, etc.).
	•	Donut charts, line graphs, heatmaps, or even animated counters to make data more dynamic.

5. Personalization/Customization
	•	Allow theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode).
	•	Let users pin or rearrange widgets.

6. Smart Use of Icons & Avatars
	•	Incorporate clean icons (Lucide, Feather, Material Icons).
	•	Show user avatars, app logos, or profile cards with subtle animations.

7. Typography & Color
	•	Use a cool font combo (e.g., Montserrat for headings, Inter for body).
	•	Stick to 2-3 main colors with complementary accents.

8. Subtle Background Patterns or Gradients
	•	Use blurry gradients, abstract shapes, or soft textures to break monotony.



Feature Quality & Monitoring
	•	Data quality metrics (null values %, distributions, outliers)
	•	Drift detection (if values change over time)
	•	Missing data trends
	•	Validation checks / alerts







1.	‘As of Today’ – Display only the records where recived_date is equal to the current date.
2.	‘Custom Range’ – Allow the user to select a start and end date, and display records where recived_date falls within that range (inclusive).”**
Reset Button:
	•	A “Clear Filters” button to reset all filters and show full data.



Use a dual-gradient color scheme in the graph—green (from dark to light) to represent success, and red (from dark to light) to represent failure.
