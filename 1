Objective:
Create a web-based tool with a user-friendly interface that allows users to input Alteryx formulas and converts them into equivalent Spark SQL expressions.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Requirements:

1. Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
	‚Ä¢	Input text area for entering Alteryx formula
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúConvert‚Äù button to trigger conversion
	‚Ä¢	Read-only output area showing the Spark SQL result
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCopy‚Äù button to copy the output to clipboard
	‚Ä¢	Responsive and modern UI (clean, colorful, intuitive)
	‚Ä¢	Tooltip or help text with example formula

2. Backend (Python with Flask)
	‚Ä¢	Receives Alteryx formula input from frontend
	‚Ä¢	Processes and converts common Alteryx functions to Spark SQL equivalents
	‚Ä¢	e.g., IIF() ‚Üí CASE WHEN, DateTimeAdd() ‚Üí DATE_ADD(), && ‚Üí AND, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Sends back the converted formula to display on the page

3. Functionality
	‚Ä¢	No page reload (can be simple POST request or basic interactivity)
	‚Ä¢	Accurate formula conversion logic
	‚Ä¢	Easy to extend with more Alteryx functions

‚∏ª

üß™ Example:

Input:
IIF([Sales] > 1000, "High", "Low")

Output:
CASE WHEN Sales > 1000 THEN "High" ELSE "Low" END













‚Ä¢	Table 1 has columns A and B
	‚Ä¢	Table 2 has columns C and NIV, where NIV indicates a hierarchy level from NIV1 (highest) to NIV5 (lowest).

I want Python code (using pandas) that does the following:
	1.	For each row in Table 1, take the value from column A.
	2.	Search for this value in column C of Table 2. If found, get its NIV level.
	3.	Try to find its parent by looking for a value in column C with a higher NIV level (e.g., if the value is at NIV5, check for a parent at NIV4, then NIV3, and so on up to NIV1).
	4.	If a parent is found and that parent value exists in column B of the same row in Table 1, then place the entire row from Table 1 into Table 3A.
	5.	If not, place the entire row into Table 3B instead.

The output should be two Excel sheets: Table3A and Table3B.








REGEX_Replace([Comment], "(\r\n)+$", "")



IF IsNull([Col1]) THEN "Col1 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col2]) THEN "Col2 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col3]) THEN "Col3 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col4]) THEN "Col4 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col5]) THEN "Col5 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col6]) THEN "Col6 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF +
IF IsNull([Col7]) THEN "Col7 is null" + '\n' ELSE "" ENDIF


IF IsNull([Col1]) THEN "Col1 is null" ELSE "" ENDIF
+ IIF(IsNull([Col2]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col2 is null", ", Col2 is null"), "")
+ IIF(IsNull([Col3]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col3 is null", ", Col3 is null"), "")
+ IIF(IsNull([Col4]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col4 is null", ", Col4 is null"), "")
+ IIF(IsNull([Col5]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col5 is null", ", Col5 is null"), "")
+ IIF(IsNull([Col6]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col6 is null", ", Col6 is null"), "")
+ IIF(IsNull([Col7]), IIF(IsEmpty([Comment]), "Col7 is null", ", Col7 is null"), "")





Build a complete Python application using Flask with the following features:

‚∏ª

üîç Functional Requirements:
	1.	HTML Frontend (Embedded in Python)
	‚Ä¢	A clean, minimal HTML form served from Flask.
	‚Ä¢	Allows user to:
	‚Ä¢	Upload an Alteryx workflow log file (text or Excel).
	‚Ä¢	Upload the corresponding dataset file (Excel/CSV).
	‚Ä¢	Submit for analysis.
	‚Ä¢	After submission, show:
	‚Ä¢	Workflow Run Time
	‚Ä¢	Success or Failure
	‚Ä¢	If failure:
	‚Ä¢	Tool that failed (ToolId and name)
	‚Ä¢	Column involved (e.g., a ‚ÄòDate‚Äô column)
	‚Ä¢	Exact row(s) and values that caused failure
	‚Ä¢	AI-generated explanation of the root cause
	‚Ä¢	Suggested fix using NLP/ML
	2.	Python Backend
	‚Ä¢	Use Flask to handle routing and file uploads.
	‚Ä¢	Parse Alteryx log file:
	‚Ä¢	Extract ToolId, tool name, error messages.
	‚Ä¢	Determine if the workflow failed and what caused it.
	‚Ä¢	Read dataset:
	‚Ä¢	Identify type mismatches in columns (e.g., strings in a Date column).
	‚Ä¢	Pinpoint bad rows and values.
	‚Ä¢	Use AI/NLP logic:
	‚Ä¢	Use sentence-transformers or GPT to generate natural-language root cause and fix suggestions.
	‚Ä¢	Log the result to a central log file (CSV or Excel), capturing:
	‚Ä¢	Workflow Name/ID
	‚Ä¢	Timestamp
	‚Ä¢	Status (Success / Failed)
	‚Ä¢	Errors Found
	‚Ä¢	Suggested Fix Summary

‚∏ª

üì¶ Output Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Put everything (Flask app, HTML frontend, and logic) into a single .py file.
	‚Ä¢	Do not use CSS files or JS ‚Äî just simple but visually clean HTML with good structure (use <div>, <table>, <hr>, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Use Python packages:
	‚Ä¢	pandas, re, datetime, openpyxl
	‚Ä¢	Optionally: sentence-transformers or openai for NLP suggestions
	‚Ä¢	The HTML should still look clean and usable ‚Äî you can use inline HTML structure, <fieldset>, <h3>, etc., to organize layout.

‚∏ª

üß† Bonus:
	‚Ä¢	Include error handling.
	‚Ä¢	Add a ‚ÄúDownload Report‚Äù button to export results as Excel.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically name the log file based on the uploaded workflow or timestamp.

‚∏ª

Please generate the complete working code for this ‚Äî one Python file only, including the embedded HTML and backend logic.
