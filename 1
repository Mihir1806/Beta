Develop a Python function parent_child(self) that determines whether a given SubProductIAS code is a child of a given Type of operation code based on a hierarchical level mapping defined in a table called SubProduct.

â¸»

ðŸ“¥ Inputs:

1. self.SubProduct (Hierarchy Table)
	â€¢	A DataFrame containing the hierarchical relationship of codes.
	â€¢	Contains the following columns:
	â€¢	Code: Unique code identifier (e.g., G00000, X05000).
	â€¢	Niv 1 to Niv 6: Hierarchy levels. Each code appears only once in one of the Niv levels.
	â€¢	One and only one Niv column is non-null for each Code.

2. self.result3 (Code Pairing Table)
	â€¢	A DataFrame containing two columns:
	â€¢	SubProductIAS: The child code.
	â€¢	Type of operation: The potential parent code.
	â€¢	These codes are to be checked against the hierarchy in self.SubProduct.
