Problem Statement:
	•	Errors captured in logs often only mention the Tool ID, not the Tool Type (e.g., Formula, Filter, Select, etc.).
	•	To understand the root cause, we are forced to manually open the Alteryx workflow to check what tool the ID belongs to.

Objective of This Dashboard:
	•	Eliminate manual lookup by building a system where tool metadata (Tool ID → Tool Name/Type) is already available.
	•	Automate the mapping of errors to tools, making it easier to analyze what kind of tools are failing and why.


Purpose:
This Excel file serves as a reference table containing metadata for all workflows.

Generated From:
Alteryx workflow that scans the workflow repository.

Process Overview:
	1.	Alteryx Workflow Execution:
	•	Reads all workflow files from a defined workflow directory path.
	2.	Metadata Extraction:
	•	For each workflow:
	•	Extracts Workflow Name
	•	Extracts Tool ID
	•	Extracts Tool Name
	3.	Excel Output Generation:
	•	Consolidates the extracted metadata into a structured Excel file.

Usage in Dashboard:
This Excel acts as a lookup table to enrich errors with tool and workflow context during the data merge phase.
