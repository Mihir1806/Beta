An Alteryx workflow should run post every release to extract workflow names, tool IDs, and tool names. This metadata can be used in Power BI and maybe in F1 for monitoring and tracking. It helps quickly identify failed tools and ensures better visibility and control across deployments.






Problem Statement:
	•	Errors captured in logs often only mention the Tool ID, not the Tool Type (e.g., Formula, Filter, Select, etc.).
	•	To understand the root cause, we are forced to manually open the Alteryx workflow to check what tool the ID belongs to.

Objective of This Dashboard:
	•	Eliminate manual lookup by building a system where tool metadata (Tool ID → Tool Name/Type) is already available.
	•	Automate the mapping of errors to tools, making it easier to analyze what kind of tools are failing and why.


Purpose:
This Excel file serves as a reference table containing metadata for all workflows.

Generated From:
Alteryx workflow that scans the workflow repository.

Process Overview:
	1.	Alteryx Workflow Execution:
	•	Reads all workflow files from a defined workflow directory path.
	2.	Metadata Extraction:
	•	For each workflow:
	•	Extracts Workflow Name
	•	Extracts Tool ID
	•	Extracts Tool Name
	3.	Excel Output Generation:
	•	Consolidates the extracted metadata into a structured Excel file.

Usage in Dashboard:
This Excel acts as a lookup table to enrich errors with tool and workflow context during the data merge phase.







1.	Input Sources
	•	Outlook Mail: Status emails (job success/failure)
	•	Excel File: Job Metadata (Job Name, Tool ID, Tool Name)
	•	Flexel Log File (Drive): Execution logs with detailed info
	2.	Data Extraction & Preprocessing
	•	Read emails and extract job status info
	•	Read Excel for tool-job mappings
	•	Read log files and extract error messages
	3.	Error Identification & Enrichment
	•	Identify jobs with errors from logs
	•	Match with status emails to verify failed jobs
	•	Lookup Tool Name from Excel using Job ID or Tool ID
	4.	Data Merge & Transformation
	•	Merge error logs, email data, and Excel metadata
	•	Clean and structure the dataset for analysis
	5.	Power BI Dashboard
	•	Visualize error trends, tool-wise failures, job performance
	•	Highlight critical issues, job-wise and tool-wise
	•	Enable filters for Tool, Date, Job Status, etc.
