Problem Statement:
	•	Errors captured in logs often only mention the Tool ID, not the Tool Type (e.g., Formula, Filter, Select, etc.).
	•	To understand the root cause, we are forced to manually open the Alteryx workflow to check what tool the ID belongs to.

Objective of This Dashboard:
	•	Eliminate manual lookup by building a system where tool metadata (Tool ID → Tool Name/Type) is already available.
	•	Automate the mapping of errors to tools, making it easier to analyze what kind of tools are failing and why.
